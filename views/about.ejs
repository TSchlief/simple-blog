            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This is a blog created by Travis Schlief during a web development bootcamp on Udemy in 2023.
                The bootcamp was instructed by Dr. Angela Yu, the lead instructor at the App Brewery.
            </p>
            <p>This project demonstrates the use of Node.js and Express.js to create a mock blog app.
                The server does not connect to a database therefore posts will not persist. </p>
